/* 
    Here is a solution with Hash map. 
    Create a Object with the array provided where, key and value are each element of the array.
    Now iterate through the array and check if (targetSum - element) is available in the object. 
    Since this is a Object property look up, the time complexity will be O(1).

    T - O(n) (array iteration and object creation)
    S - O(n) (hashmap)
